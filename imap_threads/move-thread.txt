tentative issue 422 plan:

status:

- there is one imap "singled-folder" thread that watches delta's
  incoming messages -- it can sometimes be busy with downloading larger
  files and thus sometimes have delays when for processing messages
  incoming to the DC folder

- there is one smtp thread that sends out messages with a BCC to self

- each outgoing message has a Chat-Version: 1.0 header


plan: introduce a third "move-inbox-to-dc" thread  which

1. connects to IMAP

2. fetches last N messages together with the following headers:
   - Chat-Version (to detect if it's a message esnt from a DC client)
   - In-Reply-To (to detect if it's a reply to an original DC chat)
   - From/To (to determine if BCC/me-chat messages)
   - Message-Id (to deal with out-of-order incoming replies)

3. for each message determine if it is a me-chat, bcc or otherwise incoming dc-message

3a for me-chat messages (including ASM):
- they have a chat-version header
- are addressed with From == To == deltachat-account address
- the result is: mark-message-as-read and copy it to DC folder

3b bcc-messages:
- have a chat-version header
- are addressed with From==deltachat-account address
- the result is: mark-message-as-read and move it to DC folder
  (a DC co-agent added us as BCC)

3c otherwise-incoming messages:
- if they have a Chat-Version header they are moved to DC folder

- else if In-Reply-To message-id refers to a message that is
  already in DC database, result is: move to DC folder
  if In-Reply-to message-id refers to a message in the message-dc-status
  table which is a dc-message, result is: move to DC folder

- if the message has no in-reply-to header then this is
  not a DC message

- otherwise record the message in the pending-table

3d. the result is now used for inserting the message into the
   message-dc-status table (along with it's "is_dc_status" state).
   if is_dc_status is True, then check pending-table for any
   references to the message-id and move/mark that message as well

persistence across move-thread runs:
- last checked UID

- pending-table with two columns:
  in-reply-to, UID

- message-dc-status table with two columns:
  messsage-id, determination 0=undetermined, 1=dc-message 2=not-dc-message


default plan fuer dec release:

- default is to use DC folder and move from inbox to DC  (see above)

- no configuration to change this behaviour

- (maybe expose "move" as an option)
